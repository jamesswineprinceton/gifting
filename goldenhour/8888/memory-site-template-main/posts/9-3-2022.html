<p>So often I would play hookie during my senior year of high school, claiming to be attending a "college visit" as an excuse to tag along on one of my mom's business trips. On this occasion, I was visiting the University of Miami, and a stop in dinner in South Beach was definitely in order to get the full experience. As I looked across the water towards the sun's glow upon a towering cumulonimbus cloud, I realized that this would probably be my last time traveling with my mom before college.</p>        </div>
