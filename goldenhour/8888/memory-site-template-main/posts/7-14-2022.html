<p>I was returning home from my first trip abroad. After 2 weeks spent in York, Amsterdam, and London, I was on the final step of my first solo journeyâ€”a 20 minute flight from Atlanta to Columbus. This seemingly insignificant leg of my journey proved to be the most meaningful. Never climbing past 10,000 feet, the CRJ-200 I was in rocketed over the Georgia Pines through one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever witnessed. Returning home from an exciting vacation can also leave me feeling disappointed, but on this evening, nothing could have made me happier than seeing the Georgian landscape set ablaze in lively shades of red, orange, and yellow.</p>        </div>
